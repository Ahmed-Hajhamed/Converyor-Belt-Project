# Conveyor Belt Monitoring & Control System

An embedded firmware project simulating a conveyor belt system using *Bare Metal* programming, STM32 MCU and Proteus. It measures speed, counts objects, controls motor velocity, implements an emergency stop, and displays data on a 16√ó2 LCD.

## üöÄ Features

- **Speed Measurement**  
  - Utilizes Timer Input Capture to determine belt speed
- **Motor Speed Control**  
  - Reads potentiometer via ADC  
  - Adjusts motor speed using PWM
- **Object Detection**  
  - Detects passing items using a simulated IR sensor with polling/falling-edge detection
- **Emergency Stop**  
  - Handled using a customed external interrupt driver
- **Display**  
  - Custom 16√ó2 LCD driver to present real-time metrics

## üì∏ Snapshots



## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Hajhamed/Converyor-Belt-Project.git

2. Open the `.DSN` file in Proteus and load `main.hex` into the simulated MCU.
3. Run simulation:

   * Adjust pot for motor speed
   * Send pulses for speed measurement
   * Simulate object passing with IR barrier
   * Trigger emergency stop via interrupt pin
4. See real-time data on the LCD display.

## üéì Project Insights

* **Driver modularization:** Each peripheral has its own *bare metal* API, enabling reusability.
* **Main controller logic:** Central `main()` coordinates data collection, display, and interrupt handling in a clean loop.
* **Scalability:** System architecture supports future enhancements (e.g., data logging, IoT integration).
